  Description of the element "rfgap" for a Zero length RF Gap as in Trace-3D.

  Element entry in the lattice file "sclinac.dat":

    nn  rfgap  voltage  phase  harm  aper
  
        nn: a number, not really used
    vscale: Voltage in MV
     phase: Phase in deg
      harm: Harmonic number according to the base frequency
      aper: Aperture in cm


  Example: rfgap line

    1  rfgap      0.036552  -45.0000    1.0000    1.2500

 
  In this specific example: SNS/DTL-1 converted to Quads + RF Gaps
